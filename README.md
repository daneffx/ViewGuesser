# **ViewGuesser**
A higher-lower guessing game based on YouTube video views!  
**Play at: https://viewguesser.com**

## **How to play**
You will be presented with two videos, one video on the left and a different video on the right (top and bottom if you're on mobile). These will be different random videos pulled from YouTube.

Each video will display the title, the name of the creator that made the video, the videos viewcount & the videos thumbnail in the background. There is also an option to preview each video. The view count of the first video will be displayed on the left. The video on the right will have two buttons, one for higher and one for lower. You have to guess if this video has higher or lower views than the video on the left.

Once you make your selection, the viewcount of the video will then be displayed. If you picked correctly the video will then move to the left and a new video will be populated on the right. If you picked incorrectly, the game will end and you will see a losing screen. The losing screen will change depending on your final score.

## **FAQ**
- **Q: Does the application pull random YouTube videos automatically?**  
A: Not currently, I will be working on a system to scan and populate random YouTube videos to help lessen my workload of populating manually, so hopefully I should have this implemented in the near future.

- **Q: Do the viewcounts of the videos update automatically?**  
A: Currently the viewcounts are static and are at the viewcount the video was at when the video was first populated. I am currently working on automatically pulling the current viewcounts from the YouTube API and populating this on a semi regular basis. There is currently no timeline on when this will be implemented as I will only be working on this when I find the time.

- **Q: Can I suggest videos to be added?**  
A: Yes, of course! If you have any videos you would like to see added, shoot me an email at daneb@broadbandtap.co.uk with the video title, video creator & video URL.

Please bear in mind that I created this project for fun and may not have lots of time to devote to fixing issues as I work full-time in software development, so please be patient if waiting on bug/issue fixes as I will get around to it when I find the time ðŸ˜„.
